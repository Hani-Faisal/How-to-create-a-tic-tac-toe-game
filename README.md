# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME
How to create a tic tac toe game using python.

Creating a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python is a great project to learn about game logic and user interaction. Below is a step-by-step guide along with the complete code for a console-based Tic Tac Toe game.

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1 - Set up the Game Board:

* The board is represented by a list of 9 elements.
* Positions are indexed from 0 to 8.

Step 2 - Player Input:

* Players take turns to input their move.
* Each player inputs the position where they want to place their marker (X or O).

Step 3 - Game Logic:

* Check for winning conditions after every move.
* If a player has three of their markers in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), they win.
* If the board is full and there's no winner, it's a tie.

Step 4 - Play Again Option:

* After a game ends, ask if players want to play again.
